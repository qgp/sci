  In EyE (Enhance Your Extraction) an artificial neural network
  connected to pixels of a moving window (retina) is trained to
  associate these input stimuli to the corresponding response in one
  or several output image(s). The resulting filter can be loaded in
  SExtractor to operate complex, wildly non-linear filters on
  astronomical images. Typical applications of EyE include adaptive
  filtering, feature detection and cosmetic corrections.
