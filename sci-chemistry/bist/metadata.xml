Bist stands for bidimensional structures (in italian it sounds like "beast" in english ) and is a chemical drawing tool. It is focused on organic chemistry but it may be useful also for chemists or teacher as well.
Bist support many of the formalism used to describe molecoles structures like single bond, double bond, stereospecific bond, charges, resonance arrows, lone pairs etc...
It can export both postscript and png formats.
This version is now integrated with openbabel API so virtually all the formats this library can accept should be a valid input for bist too.
Currently portability is not my goal so only GNU/Linux platform is supported. However any effort in this direction is appreciated so feel free to ask me about any porting question. Please remember that bist is actually in a beta stage of development so i strongly suggest you to not using it except for testing or hacking purpose. Bist is free software released under GNU GPL version 3
