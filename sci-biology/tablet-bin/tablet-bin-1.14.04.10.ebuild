# Upstream says regarding source code unavailability:
# Tablet uses a modified version of the BSD License which has been edited to
# remove references to distribution and use in source forms. This means that
# we are happy for you to distribute and use Tablet however you please, but we
# do not (yet) want to make the source code publicly available.

# The licence file itself is in the installer, and ends up on disk after
# installation at /opt/Tablet/docs/tablet.html
# The original BSD licence was modified to remove references to distribution
# and use in source forms, because we cannot make the source code available
# for Tablet.
