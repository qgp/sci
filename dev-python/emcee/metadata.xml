  This provides a set of sparse matrix types for Python, with modules
  which implement:
  - Iterative methods for solving linear systems of equations
  - A set of standard preconditioners
  - An interface to a direct solver for sparse linear systems of equations
  - The JDSYM eigensolver.
  All of these modules are implemented as C extension modules based on
  standard sparse and dense matrix libraries (UMFPACK/AMD, SuperLU,
  BLAS/LAPACK) for maximum performance and robustness.
