  The Virtual Monte Carlo (VMC) allows to run different simulation
  Monte Carlo without changing the user code and therefore the input
  and output format as well as the geometry and detector response
  definition.
  The core of the VMC is the category of classes vmc in ROOT. It
  provides a set of interfaces which completely decouple the
  dependencies between the user code and the concrete Monte Carlo. 
  Geant3 VMC (C++) is provided within a single package together with
  GEANT3 (Fortran) - geant3.
